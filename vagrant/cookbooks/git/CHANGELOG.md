## v2.1.0:

The repository didn't have pushed commits, and so the following
changes from earlier-than-latest versions wouldn't be available on the
community site. We're releasing 2.1.0 to correct this.

* [COOK-2020] - Add setup option attributes to Git Windows package
  install

## v2.0.0:

  call
* [COOK-1759] - git::source needs additional package for rhel
  platform_family
